The whole class, including <strong>(Name)</strong>, couldn’t stop <strong>(Verb ending in -ing)</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The submission deadline is 📅 <strong>Thursday, June 13 at 11:59pm</strong>. Late submissions will follow the late submission policy (max 5 days and max 50%), so ensure you submit on time.</p>
<h3 id="key-concepts-you’ll-need-to-know-📚">Key Concepts You’ll Need to Know 📚</h3>
<p>This assignment focuses on the following JavaScript concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input Retrieval</strong>: Retrieve user input from the provided fields in the HTML. Ensure that each field has an input; otherwise, alert the user with a message: “You didn’t enter anything. Try again.”</li>
<li><strong>String Concatenation</strong>: Assemble the inputs into a coherent story.</li>
<li><strong>Control Structures</strong>: Use <code>if</code> statements to validate the user inputs and ensure none are left blank.</li>
<li><strong>DOM Manipulation</strong>: Display the completed story in the HTML. Additionally, change the body background color to the color set for the tie in the story.</li>
<li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: Learn and implement local storage to save and retrieve the latest user’s story inputs, even if the page is refreshed.</li>
<li><strong>Event Handling</strong>: Handle click events with JavaScript and alert the user if any input field is left empty.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="marking-breakdown-⚖️">Marking Breakdown ⚖️</h3>

<h3 id="hints-🕵️">Hints 🕵️</h3>
<ol>
<li>Use online resources to understand <code>while</code> loops and local storage.</li>
<li><strong>Break It Down:</strong> Divide the assignment into smaller tasks and complete each one step by step.</li>
<li>Ensure that all input fields are filled before generating the story. Prompt the user with an alert if any field is left empty.</li>
<li>Use <code>console.log()</code> to debug your code and check the values being processed.</li>
</ol>
